# Data-Management-System
This project is developed in order to automate the data management tasks which when done manually is an exhaustive task.
For example, this can be used to convert the csv files to the json format files which can then be uploaded to the AWS S3 bucket by just one click and then can be accesed by the developer from the cloud.
Apart from that, it can also be used to generate the json format data files from the csv files so that it can be used durnig the application testing phase.
